        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p> Kenya has a rich and complex history. The country was first inhabited by hunter-gatherer tribes more than 2 million years ago. In the 1st century AD, Arab traders began to settle on the coast, and by the 8th century, a series of city-states had emerged. </p>
         <h2>Colonial Era</h2>
         <p> In the late 19th century, European powers began to colonize Africa. The British established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895, which later became Kenya. The British ruled Kenya for 70 years, during which time they exploited the country's resources and forced the local population to work on European-owned farms and plantations. </p>
          <h2>Independence</h2>
           <p> Kenya gained its independence from Britain in 1963. The country's first president was Jomo Kenyatta, who led the country for 15 years. Since independence, Kenya has faced many challenges, including political instability, corruption, and poverty. However, the country has also made significant progress in areas such as education, health, and economic development. </p>
